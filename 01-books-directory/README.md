# 01 First Project

## **Books Directory**

If youâ€™re a beginner, start with the books directory, which is the basic project created using NodeJS and Express.js. Build a book directory or an app with having a collection of books where you can create endpoints using 4 basic methods: GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE. Do check whether NodeJS and MongoDB are installed in prior, modules like nodemon to auto-restart NodeJS, server, body-parser to read & display response in JSON form, and other required modules. Keep index.js as the root file from where you can redirect to other sub-components and files.

### Features of Books Directory:

- Management of database using POSTMAN.
- Search bar to search for the required book.
- Side menu option which lists all the authors, genres, etc.
- Ensuring whether proper API calls are made and routes are connected.

### Technologies to use:

1. Nodejs
1. Express
1. MongoDB (NoSQL database).
